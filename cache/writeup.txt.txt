Hi there,
This is log/writeup for the HTB machine "Cache"

Note: Please add hms.htb with machine ip the the file /etc/hosts as the login page 
should prompt only when you visit the hms.htb page. 


Let's start,
I started with an nmap scan. The file to view should be nmap.txt


After that, I saw what was on the port 80(which was open btw)
I used a tool called dirsearch to find the login panel.

Then by using the inspect element, I found out about the username and password.
(see functionality.txt)
 
The problem was that the user could not do anything. So there was no point in
trying the use the web panel.(see panel_screenshot.png)

I now went to the author page and used cewl to make a wordlist. If you do not know
what cewl is, then let me describe it. It is a tool which you can use to make 
wordlists by fetching out every single wordon the page.

cewl -w wordlist.txt -d 10 -m 1 http://10.10.10.188/author.html

The above command will dump everything that the tool finds on the page(author.html
in my case) into wordlist.txt. The `-d` parameter will specify the depth the tool 
should spider and the `-m` parameter is for letting the tool know the minimum word 
characters that should be there. The `-w` is for specifying the output file. You 
can refer "wordlist.txt" too.


wfuzz -w wordlist.txt -H "HOST: FUZZ.htb" -u http://10.10.10.188/ --hc 400 --hh 8193

wfuzz is a directory enumeration tool that tells me the hostname(only in this case)
of the target.(see wfuzz_host.txt)

This is when the `note` at the top of writeup comes into play. When we add hms.htb 
to /etc/hosts, the hms login is now revealed.(The main one).


Let's searchsploit!(see searchsploit_output.txt)

We can see sqli. We will exploit it. When we use burp to intercept the request
in burp, we can add an sql payload(1') to the eid parameter. And an sql error gets 
thrown.

Before we exploit, we need to put the request in a txt file. So sqlmap can identify
it.(See req.txt)

We will use sqlmap to exploit the db.
sqlmap -r req.txt --dbs --batch
enumatrion after that...
(see sqlmapoutput.txt)

After that, you need to destroy the hash(not literally =) ) with john x rockyou.txt

sudo john -w=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt hash 

Got the user:pass(openemr_admin:xxxxxx)
login to panel and select administration>files
now go to revshell.png to refer the code.(change the ip and port!)

start netcat listner:
netcat -lvnp 4444

and now save the code.
now headover to:http://hms.htb/sites/default/letter_templates/custom_pdf.php
to get the shell (see shellyay.png)


Now to get the user flag, su to ash by the creds which we found earlier.

If you get- 
su: must be run from terminal
then do not worry, go here to find your answer:
https://forum.hackthebox.eu/discussion/1713/su-must-be-run-from-a-terminal
but if you are lazy, then I found the solution for you,:)
/usr/bin/script -qc /bin/bash /dev/null


cool!

now su ash
and then creds from functionality.txt(H@v3_fun)

ash shell!!!!

cd
cat user.txt
